# EmployeeDirectory

Creating a random Employee Directory. We are pulling the information from the randomuser.me API. We are only using the name, phone number, location and username. We have given it the ability to sort on the first/last name. You can also search on the first or last name case sensitive. 

There would be lots of room for improvement on this app going forward, but it was a good introduction to react and getting used to the new way of doing things.
